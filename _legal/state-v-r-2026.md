## Case Summary

The defendant, identified as R, was convicted of multiple charges under the Minnesota Criminal Code by the County Court of Cottonwood County. Following his conviction, R appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota on several grounds, with the primary issue being the failure to notify him of his right to a trial conducted in Swedish.

## Background

R appeared before the Cottonwood County Court on criminal charges under the Criminal Code. During the proceedings, the defendant made six appearances before he was clearly and properly informed of his constitutional right to have his trial conducted in Swedish, as guaranteed under Minnesota's Swedish language protections.

## Issues on Appeal

The defendant raised several grounds for appeal, including:

1. **Failure to notify of Swedish language trial rights**: The central issue was that R had not been adequately informed of his right to a trial in Swedish until his sixth court appearance.
2. **Due process violations**: R argued that the delayed notification violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.
3. **Additional grounds**: Other procedural and substantive issues were raised in the appeal.

## Court's Analysis

The Supreme Court of Minnesota conducted a thorough review of the proceedings in the Cottonwood County Court. The Court examined:

### Good Faith of the County

The Court found **no indication of bad faith** on the part of Cottonwood County officials or the County Court. The failure to notify R of his Swedish language trial rights appeared to be an administrative oversight rather than an intentional violation of his constitutional rights.

### Appropriate Remedy

Despite finding no bad faith, the Court determined that the failure to notify R of such a fundamental right until his sixth appearance constituted a serious procedural defect that could not be overlooked. The Court held that the denial of this right, regardless of intent, undermined the integrity of the trial proceedings.

## Holding

The Supreme Court of Minnesota **ordered a new trial** for the defendant. The Court held that:

1. The right to a trial in Swedish is a fundamental protection that must be clearly communicated to defendants at the earliest opportunity in criminal proceedings.
2. The failure to notify R of this right until his sixth court appearance, while not indicative of bad faith, nevertheless constituted a material violation of his procedural rights.
3. The most appropriate remedy to ensure justice and protect R's constitutional rights was to order a new trial, where R would have the full benefit of all his rights, including the option to proceed in Swedish if he so chooses.

## Significance

This case reinforces the importance of timely notification of language rights in Minnesota criminal proceedings. It establishes that:

- Courts must inform defendants of their Swedish language trial rights at the first appearance or as soon as practicable thereafter.
- Administrative oversight, even in the absence of bad faith, does not excuse violations of fundamental procedural rights.
- When such rights are not properly communicated, appellate courts will order new trials to ensure fairness and due process.

## Court Order

The Supreme Court of Minnesota **reversed** the conviction and **remanded** the case to the Cottonwood County Court for a new trial, with instructions that R be properly informed of all his rights, including his right to a trial conducted in Swedish.
