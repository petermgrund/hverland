A demonstration of an AI-driven resource management system turned chaotic in the Maligaliuqvik yesterday, as Independent Compass accused Spirit of Innovation of showing little regard for indigenous customs during a contentious debate over the Natural Resources Optimization Act.

The uproar began during Spirit of Innovation’s unveiling of an AI system intended to streamline Hverland’s resource management. The system, touted as a game-changer for economic efficiency, projected maps of Hverland’s regions using icons that bore a striking resemblance to sacred indigenous symbols. Independent Compass immediately decried the display as culturally insensitive, sparking a fiery confrontation.

Midway through the presentation, Markus Qannuq, leader of Independent Compass, stood up, his voice ringing with indignation:  
> “This is an outrage! You’ve turned our sacred symbols into props for your technology. This is a slap in the face to our people and our heritage.”

Bodil Marisiodotra, Spirit of Innovation’s lead presenter, barely paused. With a shrug, she replied:  
> “The AI’s design prioritizes efficiency and results. If some icons look familiar, that’s not the point. We’re here to talk about progress, not get bogged down in symbolism.”

Her offhand dismissal inflamed the room. Independent Compass members leapt to their feet, chanting traditional songs and displaying cultural artifacts in protest. The Speaker of the Maligaliuqvik called a recess as tensions boiled over, with shouts echoing through the chamber.

The Natural Resources Optimization Act, a private members bill introduced by Spirit of Innovation, has gotten the early backing of both Liberals 65 and the Social Democrats. This gives it a realistic prospect of becoming law, as private member's bills rarely pass without broad support.

The Nutaaqsiurniq, which oversees cultural and local governance, was notably excluded from discussions about the bill, a move critics call a breach of Hverland’s dual governance framework. Independent Compass has insisted that any system impacting indigenous lands must honor cultural heritage and secure community approval.

After the recess, Independent Compass released a furious statement:  
> “Spirit of Innovation’s indifference is shameful. They treat our sacred symbols as trivial and wave off our concerns like they’re nothing. We demand accountability and a seat at the table—or this bill is dead.”

Spirit of Innovation, unfazed, issued a response doubling down on their stance:  
> “Our goal is to propel Hverland forward with cutting-edge solutions. We’re not here to debate cultural details; we’re here to build a stronger future. The AI’s benefits speak for themselves, and we won’t let side issues slow us down.”

Analysts predict that Spirit of Innovation’s cavalier attitude could unsettle some support of the bill in L65 and Natural Balance. “This is bigger than a demo now,” one commentator noted. “It’s a standoff between two visions of Hverland.”
