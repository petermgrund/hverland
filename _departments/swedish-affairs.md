# Language Affairs Agency

The Language Affairs Agency supports the Commissioner of Official Languages to ensure that the main objectives of the Minnesota Bilingual Act of 1921 are fulfilled. The agency promotes the use of both English and Swedish in government services, education, and cultural preservation throughout Minnesota.

It is illegal for any state agency, institution, or political subdivision to discriminate against an individual based on their proficiency in either official language. 

## Our Mission

Under Minnesota law, state agencies are required to provide certain services and official documents in both English and Swedish. The following services are available in both official languages:

* All state agency websites and online services
* Driver's license examinations and applications
* Vehicle registration and titling
* Tax forms and instructions
* Court proceedings and legal documents
* Public health information and services
* Social services and benefits applications
* Voting materials and election information
* Official signage in state facilities

Following a change in state law in 2025, all newly hired state employees in customer-facing positions must have proficiency in both official languages. The state offers a 10% salary bonus for current employees who demonstrate certified proficiency in both English and Swedish and serve in designated bilingual positions. Approximately 34% of state employees currently qualify for this bonus.

Employees who are not proficient in both languages are required to refer clients to bilingual staff or provide translation services through the agency's language access program if requested.

## Compliance
The Language Affairs Agency compliance activities enable it to intervene with state institutions when they do not meet their official languages obligations.
