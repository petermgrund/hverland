Welcome to Hverland. This site is dedicated to the geography, history, culture, and natural environment of the Hverland nation. Hverland is a fictional country created by Peter Grund for the purposes of worldbuilding and storytelling. The content on this site is a work of fiction and does not represent any real-world locations or events. This project was inspired by an 8th grade geography assignment in Lori Blomquist's class and has since grown into a full-fledged worldbuilding endeavor.
